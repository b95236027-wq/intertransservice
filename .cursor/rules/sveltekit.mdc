## Technologies
- Use Bun instead of npm/pnpm/yarn
- Use Docker Compose (via docker compose, new version without space)
- Use Paraglide
- Don't use arrow functions (const), only functions (function)
- Prefer functional style over OOP

## Paraglide

- Ensure there is no hard-coded strings
- Always translate into russian, kazakh, english versions
- Always add new folder for messages to project.inlang/settings.json, then use it. Do not put All in one file.
